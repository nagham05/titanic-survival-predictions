# Titanic Predictions Project

Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning models. This project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of a supervised ML classification problem.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict passenger survival (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived) based on features like age, sex, class, family size, and more.  
- **Dataset:** Kaggle Titanic dataset (`train.csv` & `test.csv`).  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3, Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy (data handling)  
- matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)  
- scikit-learn (preprocessing, modeling, evaluation)  
- pickle (saving/loading models)  

---

## 🔑 Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration & Visualization**  
   Understand distributions, missing values, and survival patterns across features.

2. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
   Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale features, and create new features (e.g., family size, title from name).

3. **Model Building & Evaluation**  
   Test multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM. Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Prediction**  
   Predict survival for new passengers and save models using `pickle` for reuse.
